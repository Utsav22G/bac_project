# bac_project
This was the second project for Olin College of Engineering's first semester class, Modeling and Simulation in Python. In this project, we implemented both a one and three compartment model of alcohol processing in the body, from consumption to elimination. We also considered the impact of food on alcohol processing, both in terms of theoretical BAC and with rate constants.
