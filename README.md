# BAC Project
Modeling and Simulation in Python (Olin College Fall 2017) project 2 code and documentation.
# Summary
The purpose of this project was to focus on a first order system and work to use data to learn about and try to solve some interesting problem in this domain. We decided to study the movement of alcohol through the body; we built both a one-compartment "bag of blood" model and a three-compartment model that considers different organs and reaction rates. We then compared the results of these models to consider questions regarding alcohol in the body and eating. In addition to our source code, a this repository also contains a powerpoint presentation we used when presenting this work.
